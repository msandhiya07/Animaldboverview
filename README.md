Animal Dataset Analysis
Overview
This repository contains an animal dataset, which includes information on various species and their attributes. The dataset is used to perform data analysis and gain insights into different animal characteristics, behaviors, and classifications. This project aims to explore relationships between animal features such as species, habitat, size, and diet.

Dataset
The dataset, Animal_Dataset.csv, contains information about different animal species. The dataset includes the following columns:

Animal: Name of the animal species.
Species: The scientific species classification.
Habitat: The natural environment where the animal lives (e.g., forest, ocean, desert).
Diet: The dietary habits of the animal (e.g., herbivore, carnivore, omnivore).
Size: The approximate size of the animal (e.g., small, medium, large).
Lifespan: Average lifespan of the animal (in years).
Conservation_Status: The conservation status of the animal (e.g., endangered, least concern).
Region: The region where the animal is primarily found (e.g., Africa, Asia, North America).
